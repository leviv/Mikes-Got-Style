		<p align="left"><font size="4">General Assignment Requirements:&nbsp; </font>Individual assignments are to be completed by you alone. You 
			may not share code with other students or other programmers. Review the 
			class policy on improper collaboration from the class
			<a href="../syllabus.htm">syllabus</a> and how this applies to individual assignments. </p>







		<p align="left"><b><font size="4"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Follow the rules 
			from this<a href="../handouts/program_hygiene.html"> 
			program hygiene 
			guide</a>.</span></font></b></p>







		<p><b>Programs must be written in Java, using the Java 2 Platform Standard 
			Edition 8.0</b>. See the <a href="../../cs307/software.htm">software page</a> 
			for information on downloading and installing Java at home. </p>
		<p>There are 12 programming assignments.</p>







		<p>Assignments are due by 11&nbsp; pm on the due date.</p>







		<p>You will have 6 free late (slip) days in 1 day units (1 second late to 24 hours 
			late = 
			1 day) for the semester. </p>







		<ul>
			<li>You may divide your slip days across the assignments in any way you 
				wish to extend deadlines for the assignments except you may not use more 
				than 2 slip days&nbsp;on a single assignment for assignments 1 - 11. No 
				slip days may be used on the last assignment, number 12.</li>
			<li>You may not use slip days to turn an assignment back in for a 
				re-grade.</li>
			<li>Weekends and vacation days do not stop the slip day clock. For example 
				if an assignment is due on Thursday the last day you may turn it in is the 
				Saturday just after the due date. (2 slip days)</li>
			<li>If you turn in an assignment late and do not have the required number 
				of slip days, the assignment score is 0.</li>
		</ul>







		<p>&nbsp;</p>







		<p><strong>Assignments must compile and run with Java installed on the CS department 
			machines such as those in the
			</strong><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/public-labs"><strong>GDC Microlab</strong></a><strong>. You 
			are free to use IDEs, but if a program runs on your system, but not the 
			grader we will arbitrate the matter using the CS department machines and the 
			command line. If you want to test your code in that environment please see
			<a href="../handouts/SSH%20Guidelines.pdf">this handout</a> for help on logging 
			into those machines, moving, compiling, and running your Java programs. </strong></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>







		<p>Assignments must be turned in via Canvas. You must turn in a file with the correct name and in the proper 
			format. Usually this is the source code in a .java file. The assignment page 
			will specify exactly what to turn in.</p>







		<p>If you do not follow the instructions and specifications for assignments 
			(name, where to turn in, file format) you cause extra work for the graders and 
			myself. As a student and potential software developer you must follow 
			instructions and specifications. When you do not meet your responsibilities as a 
			student, it causes you to become a special case for the teaching staff. With 
			close to 200 students the TAs and undergrad proctors use scripts to streamline some 
			aspects of grading. Not following the assignment instructions and specifications 
			causes these scripts to fail and the graders must spend more time on your 
			submission. The following penalties are in place  because there must be consequences for failure to 
			meet your responsibilities as a student.
			<a href="../../cs307/handouts/followingInstructions.htm">Please read this account of a 
				student who has seen the issue from both sides</a>.</p>







		<p><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">If you fail to follow the instructions for turning in assignments you will 
			likely lose all points. Specific penalties for failure to follow instructions and specifications on 
			assignments: </span></b> </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>







		<ul>
			<li>Classes must be in the default&nbsp; (no package statement) unless 
				otherwise specified. You will lose 10 points (all correctness points) if you put a package statement 
				in your program. </li>
			<li>An assignment that does not compile or does not run, loses all 
				correctness points. You will lose correctness points because you program will 
				not compile. You must follow all instructions for the assignment so that 
				our automated testing framework can compile, run, and test your program. 
				This include naming the Java class correctly. </li>
			<li>Your program must work using Java version 8 as installed on the CS 
				department machines.</li>
			<li>There may be multiple versions of your program on your computer. We 
				will grade what you turn in. If you turn in the wrong file (for example 
				the original shell provided by the instructor with no changes) your grade 
				will suffer accordingly. Most likely a 0. (Screen shots with time stamps 
				of &quot;last modified&quot; from your system 
				are proof of nothing. It is trivial to change the system time on 
				computers or to Photoshop &quot;evidence&quot;.) Likewise if we ask for the source code, the .java file, and 
				you turn in the .class file your grade will be 0.</li>
			<li>You must add the header and fill it in for every file you turn in or 
				you may lose points.</li>
			<li>You may not use disallowed classes, methods, or programming constructs. You lose 2 points 
				per occurrence. </li>
		</ul>







		<p>Assignments grades are <b>not</b> scaled to effort or time spent working on them. (You may 
			spend a large amount of time working on an assignment and still lose many points 
			because your program is not correct.) The programs are 
			not graded on a strictly linear scale. Points will be deducted for incorrect 
			output, failed test 
			cases, poor style, poor efficiency, lack of necessary comments, convoluted 
			algorithms, lack of student provided test cases, lack of answers to questions 
			regarding the assignment, and other reasons deemed appropriate by the 
			instructor. </p>







		<p>Assignments will be checked for plagiarism and copying using

			<a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">Moss</a>. You may discuss 
			high level design issues with your fellow students, but sharing algorithms or 
			code or obtaining solutions from another source constitutes academic dishonesty 
			and will result in an F for the course. <a href="../syllabus.htm#Collaboration">Review the class policy on cheating.</a></p>







		<p>The teaching staff will grade, comment, return, and post the grade for an 
			assignment within 6 days. A grade can only be disputed within the following 
			5 days. (This isn't a weekend bazaar. If there is an error in your grade you 
			have one week to contact your grader. We won't go back at the end of 
			the term to look at an assignment from early in the term.)  </p>







		<p><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Please do not ask for a 
			regrade lightly. Your grade could in fact go down as a result of the 
			regrade. Do not quibble over a few points. Regrades are for serious issues. 
			In the past the vast majority of regrades have resulted in no change in the 
			grade or a lower grade.</span></b></p>







		<p>Please contact your 
			TA&nbsp; if you assignment is not graded in a timely and accurate 
			fashion. </p>

		<p>All grade disputes must be made in writing by email to the grader with 
			supporting evidence and will result in the entire assignment being re-graded 
			which may result in a lower grade.<hr>
